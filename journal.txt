28/01/2020
- Finished the rest of MALDI specs 
- Start Aja's project (SUBMARINE sample prep w/ liquid nitrogen)
- Made stock solution of curcumin+acetonitrile (2.5 mM)

29/01/2020
- Measured power of laser 
- Chemical safetry training (11 am)
- Tried to start Aja's experiment but there were problems with the digitizer

30/01/2020
- Worked on Feb. 3 presentation
- Tried to acquire curcumin spectra through MALDI but Reflex malfunctioned
- Tried to acquire curcumin spectra through PHAROS but laser was misaligned

31/01/2020
- Worked on Feb. 3 presentation
- Aligned red and green lasers (PHAROS)
- Tried the sample preparation w/ liquid nitrogen and hot finger 

03/02/2020
- Presented at group meeting 
- Set up for PHAROS third harmonic
- Measured PHAROS power - suspicious values, will remeasure tomorrow

04/02/2020
- Fixed issue with PHAROS power
- Tried to optimize third harmonic

05/02/2020
- Tried to optimize THG; did diode and power measurements
- Discovered that the half-wave plates were switched; check to see if it makes a difference tomorrow

06/02/2020
- Switched back the half-wave plates (to original set-up) and flipped the harmonic oscillator
